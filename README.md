# Repository Information
This repository comprises scripts for processing and analysing superflares of solar-type stars.
There are various scripts, each examining a separate method of flux fluctuation before a superflare. One script utilises the standard deviation while the other utilises peak-to-peak value. 
Additionally, the repository includes plots of all lightcurves of registered superflares.

Additionally, a list of the superflare utilized for data analysis is available (named superflares.txt and superflares_2.txt).
The file was divided into two parts due to its prolonged processing time. All scripts using the file were processed separately twice, once with each file.
